# Flight Delay Prediction
All code was written in Google Colab and later transferred here: https://github.com/jwgerlach00/flight_delay_prediction

## Conda Environment
Provided as conda_environment.yml. Create using: conda env create -f conda_environment.yml (source: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

NOTE: There may be differences in models produced with this environment as the models reported were trained in Google Colab. The reported time-series models can be found under models as bilstm_model.h5, lstm_model.h5, and hybrid_model.h5.

## Notebooks

### src/preprocessing.ipynb
Notebook for preprocessing dataset sourced from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickzel/flight-delay-and-cancellation-dataset-2019-2023?select=flights\_sample\_3m.csv

Creates processed label-encoded data and processed one-hot-encoded data. Splits data into train and test sets. Saves the data in CSV format. One-hot-encoded data was experimented with but ultimately not chosen due lacking computational power to handle a massive increase in features.

### src/baseline_models.ipynb
Trains and evaluates baseline regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network, XG Boost/

### src/build_lstm_data.ipynb
Creates datasets for time series models
1. Combines X_train and X_test
2. Sorts by date-time
3. Temporally splits the data
This is necessary because datasets used for the baseline models are shuffled.

### src/time_series_models.ipynb
Trains the time-series models.

### src/evaluate_time_series_models.ipynb
Evaluates the time-series models.
